### Termios Functions

Sure thing! termios is a term that comes from "terminal I/O settings." In Unix-like operating systems, the termios functions are part of the terminal I/O interface, providing a way to control and modify terminal settings. They are used to configure the terminal device parameters, such as baud rate, character size, control flags, and more.
